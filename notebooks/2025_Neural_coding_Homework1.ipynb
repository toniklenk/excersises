    "\n",
    "**Submission**\n",
    "- deadline is Wednesdays 8 am (such that I can give you feedback until the tutorial)\n",
    "- extended deadline is Wednesday 4 pm (with a 25% point deduction)\n",
    "- Put your name into the file name and upload to ILIAS (each team member).\n",
    "- We recommend solving the theoretical exercises inside the notebook, which will improve your Latex skills. Alternatively, submit the theoretical exercises as pdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of LLMs**\n",
    "- you are allowed and encouraged to use LLMs (github copilot is free for students, Le Chat, ChatGPT, etc.)\n",
    "- you must edit the code! Especially, make sure\n",
    "    - you understand the code,\n",
    "    - that it's correct\n",
    "    - that it's concise\n",
    "- you are responsible for your submission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plots**\n",
    "- plots must have every element labeled (axes, lines, dots, ...)\n",
    "- optionally, make your plots nicer: sns.despine(), ax.legend(frameon=False), etc.\n",
    "- choose a reasonable figsize (big enough to have everything visible, small enough to fit within the width of a hypothetical half or full A4 page)"

    "1) Take interval [0,10 sec]. We will simulate spikes within this interval to form a Poisson spike train. To do so we are going to use exponenetial distribution for inter-spike intervals. First spike-time (relative to time 0) is drawn from the exponential distribution with parameter $\\tau$ , thus $t_1 \\sim Exp(\\tau) = 1/\\tau e^{-t_1/\\tau}$. All subsequent spikes are determined relative to the previous via $t_{k+1} = t_k + \\Delta t$ with $\\Delta t \\sim Exp(\\tau)$. Stop when the new spike-time exceed 10 sec.
